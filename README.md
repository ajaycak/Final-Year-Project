# Crop Master

This project suggests using deep learning and machine learning techniques to forecast crop yield throughout India and the world, where nearly half of the population depends on agriculture for a living. The study trains the models using a variety of input variables, including weather information, soil characteristics and crop character traits. The findings demonstrate that models based on machine learning and deep learning are effective at accurately predicting crop yield. Intelligent choices about crop production and management can be made using the proposed approach by farmers and policymakers. Using stacked ensemble models of Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Bagging regressor and RNN as the meta-learner layer, the project evaluates crop yield.
